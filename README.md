## Overview

This repository implements experimental profiles for **Training Deception Probes on On-Policy Lies**. Config, caching, hooks, metrics, ablations, reporting, and CI support local pilots on small open-weight models.

Hypothesis (one line): Train and evaluate deception probes on on-policy model-generated lies rather than off-policy text.

## Status

Shared infrastructure is in place; domain stages must pass harness validation before any measured claim.
